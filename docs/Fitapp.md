                #h1   Introduction to FitApp.

The idea of an app came up after the research we did and found that most women wants to do workouts but due to some reasons like;

                 a.Lack of motivation.
                 b.Lack of equipments.
                 c.Feilure to follow workout routines due to tight schedule.
                 d.Same workout videos throught thus boredom.
                 e.Time consumption by having to go to the gym for workout.

which made their workout more challanging.In order to solve all these we designed an App that will enable our user's to workout from home or wherever they are.Once they log in into the app, they are able to view the different collections of workouts  and choose their most prefered thereafterthey will be taken to the next screen with instructors who are specifically recomended to the workout that the user chose.The instructor's are choses according to their availability.After choosing they are are supposed to book since the workouts are conducted online the user will also have to input if either they want to pay pay for a day,week or moth workout afterwhich they will be able to choose their most preffered method of payment then get's a notification on the status of their payments.The app also has a navigation that enables users to easily navigate to the profile and progress screen.Under profile the user is able to upload thier profile pictures,upload their pictures,proffesion,their names and be abble to set their workout goals.Under progress the user will be able to track their progress and records it in the app.
